# Opioid-toxicity-related-deaths-and-hospitalizations
## Summary


Canada has severely experienced the “opioid-related” deaths and other harms with tragic impact on recipients, their families, society, and ultimately the health care system. These impacts are results of multiple factors. Evidence demonstrates the impact of covid-19 pandemic on aggravating “opioid-related” overdose, death, and other harms. Overall, opioid related Emergency Medical Services (EMS) was higher than deaths in Canada from 2018 to 2020. AB, MB, followed by Ontario led the order. Ontario, however, showed slightly (insignificantly) higher deaths.   
The data shows that the highest number of deaths are among the young to middle age group (20 to 59 years old). My analysis also shows that Ontario opioid related Emergency Medical Services and deaths are equal among females and males.
Place of residence, gender and age group are strong predictors of opioid/stimulant toxicity outcome. Random Forest algorithm is recommended as the most effective machine learning model for further analysis of opioid/stimulant toxicity outcomes.
Based on my analysis, it is imperative to implement more vigorous regulations and oversee prescription. The analysis also indicates that attention of the underlying causes is required, and potentially developing and implementing social support programs for those groups at higher risk of opioid/stimulant toxicity episodes would be beneficial.
